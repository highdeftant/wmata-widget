Widget for KDE Plasma that displays train times for selected station (WIP)


Some basic information:
A very basic widget for KDE-Plasma that makes a direct API call to the WMATA servers and pulls the next train information.

Currently used by giving the 'StationName' as the argument when running the script.


Features being implemented:
- Built in Search engine for train stations
- list-like information vs in one single line
- Colored icons for train lines


Status: Works, not as expected. Still updating.
