# wmata-widget
Widget for KDE Plasma that displays train times for selected station (WIP)


# What is this?
A simple widget for KDE-Plasma that makes a direct API call to the WMATA servers and pulls the next few trains coming for that station.

Features being implemented:
    - Built in Search engine for train stations - This has been implemented and works
    - list-like information vs in one single line - This has also been completed and works
    - Colored icons for train lines - WIP


Status: Works, not as expected (to me), still happy with the result. you can search the names of the train stations in the search bar, though they have to be exact.
